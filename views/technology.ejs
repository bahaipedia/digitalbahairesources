            <h1>Technology</h1>
            <p>Our sites leverage a robust and highly scalable infrastructure designed to ensure reliability, speed, and accessibility to our global audience. Below is an overview of the technology stack that powers our platform.</p>

            <h2>Platform and Software</h2>
            <p>Wiki's like Bahaipedia are built on the MediaWiki platform, the same software that powers Wikipedia. MediaWiki ensures a familiar and stable environment, supporting collaboration and future growth. This open-source software is highly customizable, allowing us to extend its functionality to better serve our mission.</p>
            
            <h2>Infrastructure and Hosting</h2>
            <p>Our infrastructure is designed for speed and reliability, with servers strategically located across four global regions: Virginia and Oregon (USA), Singapore, SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil), and Frankfurt (Germany). This geographic distribution ensures fast and efficient access to content from anywhere in the world.</p>

            <h3>File Hosting and Distribution</h3>
            <p>Files uploaded to <a href="https://bahai.media" target="_blank">bahai.media</a> are replicated and stored in the following regions: Virginia (USA), Brazil, Singapore, and Germany. Each region serves as an origin server for CloudFront, our content delivery network (CDN). CloudFront caches and distributes the most commonly accessed files, reducing download times.</p>
            <p>Uploads are processed in the region closest to the user for efficiency, and the files are then replicated to other regions. This system ensures that users have quick access to the resources they need, no matter their location.</p>

            <h2>Traffic Handling and Caching</h2>
            <p>Our platform is built to handle a high volume of traffic efficiently and reliably. We employ a multi-layered caching strategy and utilize various technologies to ensure optimal performance.</p>

            <!-- Placeholder section for Traffic Flow details -->
            <h3>How We Handle Traffic</h3>
            <p>Our technology stack includes a robust series of systems designed to route and manage traffic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nginx</strong>: Acts as the primary web server and reverse proxy, handling HTTPS traffic and forwarding requests to Varnish.</li>
                <li><strong>Varnish</strong>: Caches and stores frequently accessed pages served to anonymous users, reducing load on the backend.</li>
                <li><strong>Redis</strong>: A second caching layer, primarily for users who are logged in, storing details such as user sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong>: Fast, full-text search capabilities across our content.</li>
                <li><strong>CloudFront</strong>: Our CDN, which distributes and caches static assets (like images, videos, and documents) globally, reducing latency for users worldwide.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda</strong>: File <a href="https://github.com/bahaipedia/lambda-edge-detect-origin">cache misses</a> are dynamically routed to the closest geographic server. Lambda also helps <a href="https://github.com/bahaipedia/lambda-bahaimedia-distribute-s3">distribute files</a> after they are uploaded.</li>
                <li><strong>Ansible and GitHub</strong>: Configuration files are centrally managed in GitHub, while Ansible automates server-specific changes before deploying updates across all regions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These technologies work together to ensure that traffic is efficiently managed, and our platform can scale as needed, even during peak usage times. Each component is optimized to handle specific types of requests and ensures a seamless user experience, regardless of location.</p>

            <h2>Custom Extensions and Code</h2>
            <p>We also develop custom extensions to enhance the functionality of our MediaWiki platform. These extensions help us provide a tailored experience for our users, improving both usability and performance.</p>

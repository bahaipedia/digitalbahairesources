            <h2>Justification</h2>
            <p>Bahaipedia.org hosts encyclopedia-style content about the Bahá’í Faith, its history, teachings, and communities. Its value lies in the relatively low barrier to entry and low costs associated with hosting this type of content. No administrative action is needed before someone can add or edit an article or correct mistakes in an existing article. Edits must be reviewed, but this requires little to no effort depending on the reputation of the contributor.</p>
